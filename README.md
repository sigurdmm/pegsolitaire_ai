# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Peg Solitaire
Assingment 1 of IT3105, accounting for 40% of the course grade.

This is the first of three projects in IT3105-Artificial Intelligence Programming at NTNU 2021. 
The outline of the project is to build a Peg Solitaire solver using Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning with both a table based approach and a neural network.

## Project purpose:
1. Gain hands-on familiarity with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and, in particular, the actor-critic model of RL.
2. Learn to use one of the popular deep-learning systems (Tensorflow or PyTorch) and how to integrate it into an RL system as a function approximator.

## 3rd party python3 libraries:
* imageio
* matplotlib
* numpy
* tensorflow

## How to run:
1. Install 3rd party dependencies
2. Modify parameters in the Settings class in main.py
3. Run main.py
4. View the optimal solution in `out/solution.gif` and see the progression of learning in `out/plot.png`
